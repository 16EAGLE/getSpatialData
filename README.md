## Introduction

`getSpatialData` is an R package in an early development stage that ultimately aims to enable homogeneous and reproducible workflows to query, preview, analyse, select, order and download various kinds of spatial datasets from open sources.

Currently, `getSpatialData` supports **159** products, including *Sentinel-1*, *Sentinel-2*, *Sentinel-3*, *Sentinel-5P*, *Landsat 8 OLI*, *Landsat ETM*, *Landsat TM*, *Landsat MSS*, *MODIS (Terra & Aqua)* and *SRTM DEMs*. For this, `getSpatialData` facilitates access to multiple services implementing clients to public APIs of *ESA Copernicus Open Access Hub*, *USGS EarthExplorer*, *USGS EROS ESPA*, *Amazon Web Services (AWS)*, *NASA DAAC LAADS* and *NASA CMR search*. A full list of all supported products can be found below.

## Installation

To install the current beta version, use `devtools`:

```R
devtools::install_github("16EAGLE/getSpatialData")
```

## Workflow

The `getSpatialData` workflow to query, preview, analyse, select, order and download spatial data is designed to be as reproducible as possible and is made of six steps: 

1. **querying** products of interest (see `get_products()`) for available records by an area of interest (AOI) and time (see `get_records()`),
2. **previewing** geometries and previews of the obtained records (see `get_previews()`, `view_records()` and `view_previews()`),
3. **analysing** records by deriving scene and AOI cloud distribution and coverage directly from preview imagery (see `calc_cloudcov()`),
4. **selecting** records based on user-defined measures (see `select_unitemporal()`, `select_bitemporal()` and `select_timeseries()`),
5. **ordering** datasets that are not available for immediate download (on-demand) but need to be ordered or restored before download (see `check_availability()` and `order_data()`), and lastly
6. **downloading** the full datasets for those records that have been selected in the process, solely based on meta and preview-dervied data.

For all steps, `getSpatialData` supports local chaching to reduce bandwith usage and uneccasary downloads.

This approach is implemented by the following functions (sorted by the order in which they would be typically used):

#### Logging in

* `login_CopHub()` logs you in at the ESA Copernicus Open Access Hub using your credentials (register once at https://scihub.copernicus.eu/).
* `login_USGS()` logs you in at the USGS EROS Registration System (ERS) using your credentials (register once at https://ers.cr.usgs.gov/register/).
* `login_earthdata()` logs you in at the NASA Earth Data User Registration System (URS) using your credentials (register once at https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new)
* `services_avail()` displays the status of all online services used by `getSpatialData`. 

#### Defining session settings

* `set_aoi()`, `view_aoi()` and `get_aoi()` set, view and get a session-wide area of interest (AOI) that can be used by all `getSpatialData` functions.
* `set_archive()` and `get_archive()` set and get a session-wide archive directory that can be used by all `getSpatialData` functions.

#### Retrieving and visualizing records

* `get_products()` obtains the names of all products available using `getSpatialData`. Currently, `getSpatialData` supports **159** products, including *Sentinel*, *Landsat*, *MODIS* and *SRTM* products.
* `get_records()` queries a service for available records using basic input search parameters such as product name, AOI and time range and returns an `sf data.frame` containing meta data and the geometries of each record.
* `view_records()` and `plot_records()` display the footprint geometries of each record on a map.

#### Analysing previews

* `get_previews()` downloads and georeferences preview images for visual inspection or automatic analysis and saves them to disk.
* `view_previews()` and `plot_previews()` load and display georeferenced previews acquired using `get_previews()`.
* `get_cloudcov_supported()` tells you for which products preview-based cloud coverages can be calculated using `calc_cloudcov()`.
* `calc_cloudcov()` calculates the AOI cloud cover and optionally saves raster cloud masks, all based on preview images.

#### Selecting records

* `select_unitemporal()` selects remote sensing records (both optical and SAR across different products) *uni-temporally* according to AOI cloud cover (in case of optical data) and temporal characteristics.
* `select_bitemporal()` selects remote sensing records (both optical and SAR across different products) *bi-temporally* according to AOI cloud cover (in case of optical data) and temporal characteristics.
* `select_timeseries()` selects remote sensing records (both optical and SAR across different products) for a *time series* according to AOI cloud cover (in case of optical data) and temporal characteristics.
* `is.*()`, such as `is.sentinel()`, `is.landsat()`, `is.modis()` and more to simplify filtering of records.

#### Checking, ordering and downloading records

* `check_availability()` checks for each record whether it is available for direct download (can be downloaded instantly) or not (and thus must be ordered before download).
* `order_data()` oders datasets that are not available for immediate download (on-demand) but need to be ordered or restored before download.
* `get_data()` downloads the full datasets per records.

#### Writing and reading

* `get_records_drivers()` provides the driver names that can be used in `write_records()`.
* `write_records()` writes records, e.g. as `GeoJSON`, for later use.
* `read_records()` reads records that have been written through `write_records()`.
* `read_previews()` reads georeferences preview images downloaded using `get_previews()`.
