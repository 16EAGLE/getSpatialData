\title{Preview a Sentinel product}
\usage{
getSentinel_preview(product, on_map = TRUE, show_aoi = TRUE,
  username = NULL, password = NULL, hub = "auto")
}
\arguments{
\item{product}{data.frame, single row data.frame collected from the return of \link{getSentinel_query}, representing the selected product and all its attributes.}

\item{on_map}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, the preview is displaed corner-georeferenced on a map. If \code{FALSE}, a simple RGB plot is displayed. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{show_aoi}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, the session AOI defined with \link{set_aoi} is drawn to the map viewer. Ignored, if \code{on_map = FALSE} or if no AOI has been defined with \code{set_aoi}. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{username}{character, a valid user name to the Copernicus Open Access Hub. Default is NULL. Leave it undefined, if you want to use use \link{login_CopHub} to define the login credentials once for all \code{getSentinel*} functions during the session. Register on \url{https://scihub.copernicus.eu/}. Not needed for connections to the pre-operational hub.}

\item{password}{character, the password to the specified user account. If \code{NULL}, the password will be taken from \link{login_CopHub} inputs or, if \code{login_CopHub} is not in use, asked interactively. Not needed for connections to the pre-operational hub.}

\item{hub}{character, either "auto" to access the Copernicus Open Access Hubs by \code{platform} input, "operational" to look for ESA's operational products from the Open Hub,  "pre-ops" to look for pre-operational products from the Pre-Ops Hub (e.g. currently all Sentinel-3 products), or an valid API URL. Default is "auto".}
}
\value{
None. A plot/view display is generated.
}
\description{
\code{getSentinel_preview} previews single products as RGB plot which had been queried using \link{getSentinel_query}. The function is useful to apply visual checks to products before downloading them.

\examples{
## Load packages
library(getSpatialData)
library(sf)
library(sp)

## Define an AOI (either matrix, sf or sp object)
data("aoi_data") # example aoi

aoi <- aoi_data[[3]] # AOI as matrix object, or better:
aoi <- aoi_data[[2]] # AOI as sp object, or:
aoi <- aoi_data[[1]] # AOI as sf object

## set AOI for this session
set_aoi(aoi)
view_aoi() #view AOI in viewer
# or, simply call set_aoi() without argument to interactively draw an AOI

## Define time range and platform
time_range <-  c("2017-08-01", "2017-08-30")
platform <- "Sentinel-2"

## set login credentials and an archive directory
\dontrun{
login_CopHub(username = "username") #asks for password or define 'password'
set_archive("/path/to/archive/")

## Use getSentinel_query to search for data (using the session AOI)
products <- getSentinel_query(time_range = time_range, platform = platform)

## Get an overview of the products
View(products) #get an overview about the search products
colnames(products) #see all available filter attributes
unique(products$processinglevel) #use one of the, e.g. to see available processing levels

## Filter the products
products_filtered <- products[which(products$processinglevel == "Level-1C"),] #filter by Level

## Preview a single product
getSentinel_preview(product = products_filtered[5,])

## Download some datasets
files <- getSentinel_data(products = products_filtered[c(4,5,6),])
}
